Protocol:

- Add a version stamp at startup

- Packet numbering:
  - Fix constant 0 packet numbering in packet.c
  - Modify the spec to allow non-zero starting packet numbers
  - Modify srcmd to initialize the outgoing packet number to a random
    number at startup.

- Modify the daemon to support multiple authorized keys.

- Fix "PIPE" handling (ie "yes" command when remote closes).

- Use cli library in server (?)

- Check permissions of ~user .srcmd and authorized_key

- Modify the daemon to handle user-specified command handlers:
  Instead of requiring the executing command on the command line:
  - If command line is set, use it to execute given command
  - Else if ~user/.srcmd/shell is executable, execute it with the command
  - Else, use /bin/sh -c
